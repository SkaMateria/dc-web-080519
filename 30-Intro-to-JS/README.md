## Intro to Javascript
- Invented to compete with native Desktop applications
    - Brendan Eich developed the proposal for NetScape in 10 days
- HTML, CSS, and JS (behavior)
- The index.html file MUST contain a script tag reference to the script.js file
    - Page load order

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (console.log(), alert(), debugger)
- Debugger & Chrome console tools (step through, into, over functions)
- If you're unsure of something, try it!
- Reading Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

## Difference between Ruby and JS
- JS tries to avoid throwing errors (NaN, undefined returns, missing/too many args)
- Interpolation syntax is different
- Everything is an object
- Type coercion (why was it designed this way?)
- Lacking implicit functional returns


### Datatypes
- What types and how many?
    - Number (and friends NaN, Infinity, -Infinity), string, boolean, null, undefined, array, object, function, symbol
    - Using binary operators with numbers and strings
- Truthy vs. falsy values
- Everything is an object


### Pass by Value versus Pass by Reference
- Octopus metaphor
- "Pointing" to locations in memory (reference ruby object ids)
- Changing objects in a variable chain


### Functions as Objects
- all the difference ways to write functions
    - Declaration
    - Expression
    - Arrow function (ES2015)
- hoisting (pre/post ES2015)
