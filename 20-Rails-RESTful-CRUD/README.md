* Objectives
    - Build a Rails RESTful app with full CRUD capabilities
      - Distinguish between `form_for` and `form_tag`, and use both helpers
      - Use Rails link helpers to build links
      - Use `rails routes` to abstract URLs
      - Use `before` actions to minimize repeated code

## What questions do you have?
- rails generate --> which one(s) to use??
- CRUD stuff --> how does everything connect?
