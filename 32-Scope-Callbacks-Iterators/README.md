## Pass by value , pass by reference

- pass by value
  - takes place with primitive data types
    - boolean
    - number
    - strings
    - undefined
    - null

- pass by reference
  - takes place with non-primitive data types
    - arrays, objects

## Scope
- bounds of where variables/resources are available
- kinds:
  - global
  - functional
  - block
- scope chain
  - is 'locked-in' where function is declared

## Callbacks
- a function that is passed as argument to another function

- functions are "first-class" objects
- functions as variables

## Writing Callbacks
- as declarations
- as expressions
- as arrow functions

## Iterators
- .forEach, .map, .filter, .find, .reduce

## Building our own forEach
- map?
- filter?
- find?
- reduce?
